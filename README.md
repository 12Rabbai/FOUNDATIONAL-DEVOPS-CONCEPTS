# DevOps Foundational Lifecycle Project

This Article explores the foundational concepts and lifecycle stages of DevOps.

## 1. Foundational DevOps Concepts

**DevOps** is a set of practices that bridges the gap between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to increase an organizationâ€™s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity.

### Core Principles:
- **Collaboration**: Breaking the barrier between development and operations teams.
- **Automation**: Automating repetitive tasks such as testing and deployment.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)**: Regularly merging code and delivering it reliably.
- **Monitoring & Feedback**: Constantly measuring performance and gathering feedback to improve.

## 2. DevOps Lifecycle Stages

- **Planning**: Define project scope, gather requirements, and outline tasks.
- **Development**: Write and review code, often collaboratively using tools like Git.
- **Building**: Convert source code into executable packages using build tools.
- **Testing**: Run automated and manual tests to catch bugs early.
- **Release**: Prepare the application for deployment, ensuring it's stable and secure.
- **Deployment**: Push code to production environments, often using CI/CD pipelines.
- **Operations**: Manage infrastructure and maintain system reliability.
- **Monitoring**: Continuously track system performance and user activity to detect issues.
This is a clear, concise, and structured README.md file that demonstrates my understanding of DevOps principles and the lifecycle of modern software delivery.
